# MagicBox2.5
Repo for software and hardware for the MagicBox 2.5 Tx/Rx interface 

The K8IQY/KU4QO MagicBox V2.5, is an updated version of the project
designed by K8IQY in 2013 and kitted by the 4 State QRP group. In the prior
version, the MagicBox could be used to connect a receiver and a transmitter
together to operate as a transceiver, with all of the RF switching and Audio Muting
handled by the MagicBox. It used a programmed microprocessor to control the
functions within the box.
The updated version provides all of the RF Switching and Audio Muting
functionality of the original, along with addition of an internal, speed adjustable,
CW Keyer, power control for transmitters requiring an external power source to be
switched, such as a Tuna Tin 2, and a redesign of the PIN diode RF Switching
circuitry to handle higher transmitter power levels. This version should handle
transmitters below 20 watts, with very low loss.
